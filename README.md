Generic Robot Adventure

You are a generic robot who would like to escape from a generic warehouse full of generic, blandly textured obstacles - and also you can poke other robots (that we will assume are evil for the time being) with your robot sword (which you have for some reason).

Generic Robot Adventure! was made over the course of a week for the OLC CodeJam 2020 in GameMaker Studio 2.3. Levels are randomly generated with a recursive backtracking maze generator and are processed into vertex buffers because in a fit of naivety, I thought that would be easier than making a few more tiles. Well, at least the levels can be rotated easily this way.


Controls:

    Movement - WASD or Gamepad d-pad/left stick
    Attack - Shift or Gamepad face button 3
    Rotate Map - Q and E or Gamepad shoulder buttons
    Restart Game - CTRL + R
    Return to Title - Escape
    Toggle "Debug Mode" - CTRL + D

While in "Debug Mode":

    Zoom map - Z and X
    Spawn Enemy - CTRL + E
    Spawn Boss - CTRL + R
    Spawn Treasure - CTRL + T
    Also, player robot will run while in "Debug Mode"
